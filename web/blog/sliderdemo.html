<h1 id="zero-knowledge-traders-redrawn">Zero-Knowledge Traders, Redrawn</h1>
<p>This document is a simple, interactive review of the zero-knowledge traders.</p>
<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>
<p>You have to sell 50 kilos of fresh mozzarella cheese every day.<br>You have no idea what the right price of your cheese is. You want to make money but you don&#39;t want to have unsold cheese since it spoils overnight. What should you do? Give it a try!</p>

<slider-demo-gui></slider-demo-gui>

<p>You probably did a combination of two things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trial and Error: whenever you attracted too many people you raised the price, whenever you attracted too few you lowered the price</li>
    <li>Learning: you figured out the demand for cheese is linear and from it derived the correct price</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem you solved is the basics of the zero-knowledge methodology. You have agents that are price-makers and have no knowledge of the world around them so they proceed by experimentation.  </p>
<p>In the previous example you were tinkering with the price slider, when running computer simulations I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controllers</a> take your place. They are just an easy way to automate trial-and-error. See for yourself:</p>
