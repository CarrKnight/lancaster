What is this
=============

Basically the last part of my dissertation. Which is just PID controllers in space.
I have already a working model of this in the old Java codebase. Unfortunately I do not have the money needed to pay for a
security key which makes java applets useful. Applets are dead. Since they are dead I can't really host them online.
Because my previous two models really, nobody bother replicating them or playing with them I started to think if I just let
people play with them in the browser it will work out okay. We will see.

Right now I am looking at dart with mixture of hope and rage. Maybe this will flourish, probably not. We will see.
