What is this
=============

Basically the last part of my dissertation. Which is just PID controllers in space.
I have already a working model of this in the old Java codebase. Unfortunately I do not have the money needed to pay for a
security key which makes java applets useful. Applets are dead. Since they are dead I can't really host them online.
I made the code available for my previous papers but nobody either replicated or even played around with it. Reading other people code
 is dreary so I don't blame anyone. Still I want people to at least play around with this one which is why I am coding it as a webapp.
 W will see.

Right now I am looking at dart with mixture of hope and rage. Maybe this will flourish, probably not. We will see.
