##Fixed Wages

The firm production function looks like this: $$
Y = \sqrt{L} - 5
$$So there is a small fixed cost. This is actually necessary to have a solution.

There is an infinitely elastic wage supply $$ w = 1$$ This way we don't really worry about wages at all and the solution is in wage-units.

Workers consume all their pay every day, so that:
$$ 
\text{Demand} = \frac{w L}{p}
$$

The profit maximizing function then is:
$$
\Pi = pY - wL 
$$ Since wages are going to be 1 when we substitute the production function in we get:
$$
\Pi = p ( \sqrt{L}+b) - L
$$ Assuming perfect competition when maximizing profits
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial L} &= 0 \\
 p \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{L}} &= 1
\end{align*}
$$ And so
$$
 p = 2 \sqrt L
$$


Now we assume demand equals supply and so
$$
\begin{align*}
 \frac{w L}{p} &=  \sqrt{L} - 5\\
 \frac{L}{2 \sqrt L} &=  \sqrt{L} - 5\\
  \sqrt L &=  10\\
\end{align*}
$$

So the final result is:
>$$
\begin{align*}
 L &= 100 \\
 p &= 20 \\
 Y &= 5
\end{align*}
$$
